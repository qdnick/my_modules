    <h1>HR Hospital Module</h1>
    <p>The hr_hospital module is designed to automate hospital operations within the Odoo system. It provides tools for
        managing doctors, patients, interns, and their visits. Doctors can create and review patient visits, track
        medical history, and monitor visit status. Interns, under the supervision of mentors (doctors), can edit their
        visits and access treatment information. Managers have access to hospital statistics and all relevant data,
        while administrators can manage all records.</p>
